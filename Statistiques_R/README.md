## Introduction

This detailed statistical analysis focuses on the **Moreno**, **Varios**, **Barcelona**, and **Carmona** collections, preserved at the University of Geneva Library. The aim of this study is to explore the distribution of toponyms and other textual characteristics within these collections, in order to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the *Pliegos de Cordel* corpus.

## Methodology

### 1. General Analysis of the Corpus (*Análisis General del Corpus*)

The first step of the analysis involved examining the overall occurrences of toponyms throughout the corpus. This visualization allows us to identify the most frequently mentioned places and appreciate their relative prevalence. By understanding the general distribution of toponyms, we can discern trends and determine which places captured the collective imagination of the readers of that era.

### 2. Distribution of Toponyms by Collection (*Distribución de Topónimos por Colección*)

The analysis was then segmented by collection. By grouping toponyms according to their presence in the **Moreno**, **Varios**, **Barcelona**, and **Carmona** collections, it was possible to observe the specific contribution of each collection to the mention of certain places in the corpus. This distribution highlights the peculiarities of each collection and reveals differences in the geographical dissemination of the texts.

### 3. Distribution of Toponyms by Publication Date (*Distribución de Topónimos por Fecha de Publicación*)

Toponym analysis was also conducted based on the periods of publication. By classifying place names according to specific decades or publication periods, it is possible to trace the evolution of the mention of certain places over time. This approach helps to highlight the influence of historical events, shifts in interests, or the evolution of peddling routes.

### 4. Distribution of Toponyms by Place of Publication (*Distribución de Topónimos por Lugar de Publicación*)

The distribution of toponyms according to the places of publication was also examined. Given the large number of publication locations, geographically close cities were grouped together. This analysis helps to better understand the centers of production and dissemination of popular culture at the time, as well as the local concerns that influenced the production of *Pliegos de Cordel*.

### 5. Distribution of Toponyms by Type of Text (*Distribución de Topónimos por Tipos de Texto*)

The analysis was further refined by classifying the texts according to their type. The texts were grouped into several categories, such as *Textos Narrativos*, *Poesías y Canciones*, *Textos Dramáticos y Teatrales*, and *Textos Diversos*. This categorization allows for the examination of the distribution of toponyms based on literary genre, revealing how certain places were specifically associated with particular types of texts.

### 6. Distribution of Places by Sacred/Profane Aspect of the Text (*Distribución de los Lugares según el Aspecto Sagrado/Profano del Texto*)

Finally, an exploration of the distribution of toponyms was conducted based on the sacred or profane nature of the texts. This analysis reveals how certain places were particularly associated with religious or profane contexts, offering insights into the geographical and religious imaginaries that shaped the representations of the world in the *Pliegos de Cordel*.
